            I was an EMT for many years before I joined bootcamp. I've been
            looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had and
            amazing experience there. I signed up for the three Intro course and
            found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
            weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
            completing the course , I've successfully switched careers, working
            as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.

            The staff seems genuinely concerned about my progress which I find

            be able to out in the world and present myself as a capable junior
            devveloper. The standard is above the rest. You will get the
            personal attention you need from the incredible community of smart

            Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I
            needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
            programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things bout the
            program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. There
            were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The
            agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
            learning to the next levvel in a way that no tutorial could ever
            have. In fact, I've often reffered to it during interviews as an
            example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a
            job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
            recommended!
